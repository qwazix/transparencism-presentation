# FOSDEM18 presentation

This is my presentation at FOSDEM18 which talks about transparencism, 
an approach to design which aims to teach people how the things they 
use work, instead of trying to be "magic".

I used blender to present it. You just open the .blend file, 
press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd><-</kbd> to go to the Default View, 
reload as trusted and click "Revert"

Then you will be shown the presentation screen again and now you can navigate
using the mouse back/forward keys and the keyboard arrow keys.

Unfortunately you have to wait for the animation to finish before you 
advance to the next slide. <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd> <- </kbd> goes to the 
beginning.

On macOS, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd><-</kbd> changes workspaces so you will 
need to change the keymapping before you open the file.
 
You will also need to put these videos in the root of the repository for the 
presentation to work correctly
